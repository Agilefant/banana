Implement and test more primitive types in IPrimitiveAccess
	char[]
	double
	float
	
Unified interface for collections and have all collections implement ICollection

evaluate interesting use cases enabled by compressed pointers
  more efficient MultiSize allocator
optimize malloc/read/write/free allocators
  
Implement MultiList:
  tests
  
Implement and test MemCopy for IMemAllocator
Implement Double and Float in IPrimitiveAccess

Implement Set

Memory allocation:
  ByteBuffer allocator
  Unsafe Allocator
  Memory mapped file allocator?

When API stable complete tests and documentation
