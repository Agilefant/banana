Support Initializers for multiblock IMemAllocators (variable length allcoation)


Unified interface for collections and have all collections implement ICollection

Look into more traditional IMemAllocators implementations

Consider using BlockAllocator as an underlying storage of Buffer class

evaluate interesting use cases enabled by compressed pointers
  more efficient MultiSize allocator
optimize malloc/read/write/free allocators
  
Implement MultiList:

Implement Set

Memory allocation:
  ByteBuffer allocator
  Unsafe Allocator
  Memory mapped file allocator?
